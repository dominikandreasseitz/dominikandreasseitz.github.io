### Welcome
I'm Dominik, a software engineer with a focus in Machine Learning.
I currently work as a senior software engineer at [PASQAL](https://pasqal.com) on quantum machine learning.


### Cool stuff I was part of

#### Algorthmic Game Theory and Reinforcment Learning Research
I have previously worked in algorithmic game theory research focussing on solving large partially-observable games which most notably lead to a Artificial Intelligence journal [publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2022.103805).

#### Quantum Machine Learning
At [Pasqal](https://pasqal.com), I was responsible for the development and optimization of their main torch-based computational backend[pyqtorch](https://github.com/pasqal-io/pyqtorch) and their JAX backend [horqrux](https://github.com/pasqal-io/horqrux).
I was also part of the scientific software library for quantum machine learning, [Qadence](https://github.com/pasqal-io/qadence). Check out the white paper [whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09915).
